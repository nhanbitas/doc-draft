            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            The simplest and fastest way to get up and running with Tailwind CSS from scratch is with the
            Tailwind CLI tool. The CLI is also available as a standalone executable if you want to use it
            without installing Node.js.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="anchor text-heading-03 mb-2 text-gray-400">Editor Setup</h3>
            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            Plugins and configuration settings that can improve the developer experience when working with
            Tailwind CSS. We maintain an official Prettier plugin for Tailwind CSS that automatically sorts
            your classes following our recommended class order. It works seamlessly with custom Tailwind
            configurations, and because it's just a Prettier plugin, it works anywhere Prettier works —
            including every popular editor and IDE, and of course on the command line.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="anchor text-heading-03 mb-2 text-gray-400">Using with Preprocessors</h3>
            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            Since Tailwind is a PostCSS plugin, there's nothing stopping you from using it with Sass, Less,
            Stylus, or other preprocessors, just like you can with other PostCSS plugins like Autoprefixer.
            It's important to note that you don't need to use a preprocessor with Tailwind — you typically
            write very little CSS on a Tailwind project anyways so using a preprocessor just isn't as
            beneficial as it would be in a project where you write a lot of custom CSS.

        <div>
            <h3 class="anchor text-heading-03 mb-2 text-gray-400">Optimizing for Production</h3>
            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            Tailwind CSS is incredibly performance focused and aims to produce the smallest CSS file
            possible by only generating the CSS you are actually using in your project. For the smallest
            possible production build, we recommend minifying your CSS with a tool like cssnano, and
            compressing your CSS with Brotli.

            <h3 class="anchor text-heading-03 mb-2 text-gray-400">Responsive Design</h3>
            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which
            makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="anchor text-heading-03 mb-2 text-gray-400">Dark Mode</h3>
            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            Now that dark mode is a first-class feature of many operating systems, it's becoming more and
            more common to design a dark version of your website to go along with the default design. To
            make this as easy as possible, Tailwind includes a dark variant that lets you style your site
            differently when dark mode is enabled.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3 class="anchor text-heading-03 mb-2 text-gray-400">Reusing Styles</h3>
            <p class="text-body-02 text-white">
            Tailwind encourages a utility-first workflow, where designs are implemented using only low-level
            utility classes. This is a powerful way to avoid premature abstraction and the pain points that
            come with it. But of course as a project grows, you'll inevitably find yourself repeating common
            utility combinations to recreate the same design in many different places.
